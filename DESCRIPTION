Description: This package is being developed at LETS (Laboratório de Ecologia Teórica e Síntese) in 
UFG (Universidade Federal de Goiás, Brazil) as part of a larger project looking to integrate recent 
advances in macroecological data handling and processing. Its purpose is to make some of our commonly
used but unavailable R functions available to the larger public. The package provides useful R functions
for researchers in ecology and evolution.
