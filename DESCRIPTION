Description: This package is being developed at LETS (Laboratorio de Ecologia
    Teorica e Si?ntese) in UFG(Universidade Federal de Goias, Brazil) as part
    of a larger project looking to integrate recent advances in macroecological
    data handling and processing. Its purpose is to make some of our commonly
    used but unavailable R functions available to the larger public. The
    package provides useful R functions for researchers in ecology and
    evolution.
