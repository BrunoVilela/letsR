Description: R functions for handling and analyzing geographic data, mainly
    species' geographic distributions (in ESRI shapefile format) and
    environmental variables (in raster format), as well as species' information
    related to their description (e.g. taxonomy and year of description) and
    conservation status (e.g. category of threat, population trend) as provided
    by the IUCN's RedList database. The package includes functions to create
    presence-absence matrices based on species distributions and user-defined
    grid systems, from which several other functions could be applied to
    generate, for example, species richness rasters and maps, and geographical
    midpoints of species. In addition, it provides a function to create spatial
    correlograms of variables, based on the Moran's I index, under the
    equiprobable or equidistant criterion to define distance classes.
