Its purpose is to make some of our commonly used but unavailable R functions available to the larger public. The package provides useful R functions for researchers in ecology and evolution.\n\nThe letsR package is in continuous development and suggestions are more than welcome!\n\nWe hope you enjoy it and find it useful.\n\n====\n## Package donwload and install\nYou can download this package using the function `install_git` from the package `devtools`.\n\nFor this package version to work properly, you should previously install and load the following R packages:\n- `maps` \n- `maptools` \n- `raster` \n- `XML`\n\n## Key functions\n- `lets.presab`: Builts a presence-absence matrix (sites x species) based on species’ range maps from shapefiles.\n- `lets.presab.birds`: Builts a presence-absence matrix (sites x species) based on species’ range maps from shapefiles (specially designed for the BirdLife International database).\n- `lets.shFilter`: Filter species’ shapefiles by origin, presence and seasonal type (following IUCN categorization of species’ distributional ranges).\n- `lets.addvar`: Add variables in raster format to a presence-absence matrix.\n- `lets.addpoly`: Add variables in polygon format to a presence-absence matrix.\n- `lets.maplizer`: Summarize species atributes per cell in a presence-absence matrix.\n- `lets.field`: Generate a species' attribute based on the attribute value of other species that cooccur in it's geographic range.\n- `lets.iucn`: Get species’ information from the IUCN website.\n- `lets.iucn.ha`: Get species’ habitat information from the IUCN website.\n- `lets.iucn.his`: Get information on the history of species’ conservation status from the IUCN website.\n\nTake a look at the functions' help files for more information.\n\nTry the R functions `summary` and `plot` with the object of class `PresenceAbsence`.\n",
