\title{Create a presence-absence matrix of species' geographic ranges within a grid}
\usage{
lets.presab(shapes, xmn = -180, xmx = 180, ymn = -90, ymx = 90,
  resol = 1, remove.cells = TRUE, remove.sp = TRUE, show.matrix = FALSE,
  crs = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"), crs.grid = crs, cover = 0,
  presence = NULL, origin = NULL, seasonal = NULL, count = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapes}{Object of class \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} (see function \code{\link{readShapePoly}} 
to open these files) containing the distribution of one or more species.
Species names should be in a column (within the .DBF table of the shapefile) 
called BINOMIAL/binomial or SCINAME/sciname.}

\item{xmn}{Minimun longitude used to construct the grid in which the matrix will be based 
(i.e. the [gridded] geographic domain of interest)}

\item{xmx}{Maximun longitude used to construct the grid in which the matrix will be based 
(i.e. the [gridded] geographic domain of interest)}

\item{ymn}{Minimun latitude used to construct the grid in which the matrix will be based 
(i.e. the [gridded] geographic domain of interest)}

\item{ymx}{Maximun latitude used to construct the grid in which the matrix will be based 
(i.e. the [gridded] geographic domain of interest)}

\item{resol}{Numeric vector of length 1 or 2 to set the grid resolution.}

\item{remove.cells}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} the final matrix will not contain cells in the 
grid with a value of zero (i.e. sites with no species present).}

\item{remove.sp}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} the final matrix will not contain species that 
do not match any cell in the grid.}

\item{show.matrix}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} only the presence-absence matrix will be returned.}

\item{crs}{Character representign the PROJ.4 type description of
a Coordinate Reference System (map projection) of the polygons.}

\item{crs.grid}{Character representign the PROJ.4 type description of
a Coordinate Reference System (map projection) for the grid. 
Note that when you change this options you may probably change 
the extent coordinates and the resolution.}

\item{cover}{Porcentage of the cell covered by the shapefile that will be considered for presence 
(values between 0 and 1). This option is only available when the coordinates 
are in degrees (longitude/latitude).}

\item{presence}{A vector with the code numbers for the presence type to be considered in the process 
(for IUCN spatial data \url{http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data}, see metadata).}

\item{origin}{A vector with the code numbers for the origin type to be considered in the process 
(for IUCN spatial data).}

\item{seasonal}{A vector with the code numbers for the seasonal type to be considered in the process 
(for IUCN spatial data).}

\item{count}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} a counting window will open.}
}
\value{
The result is a list object of class \code{\link{PresenceAbsence}} with the following objects:

\strong{Presence-Absence Matrix}: A matrix of species' presence(1) and absence(0) information. 
The first two columns contain the longitude (x) and latitude (y) of the cells' centroid 
(from the gridded domain used);

\strong{Richness Raster}: A raster containing species richness data;

\strong{Species name}: A character vector with species' names contained in the matrix.

*But see the optional argument \code{show.matrix}.
}
\description{
Convert species' ranges (in shapefile format) into a presence-absence matrix based on a user-defined grid system
}
\details{
The function creates the presence-absence matrix based on a raster object. 
Depending on the cell size, extension used and number of species it may require a lot of memory, 
and may take some time to process it. Thus, during the process, if \code{count} argument is 
set \code{TRUE}, a counting window will open so you can see the progress 
(i.e. in what polygon/shapefile the function is working). Note that the number of 
polygons is not the same as the number of species that you have 
(i.e. a species may have more than one polygon/shapefiles).
