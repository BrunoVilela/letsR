\title{Filter species' shapefiles based on its presence, origin, and season}
\usage{
lets.shFilter(shapes, presence = NULL, origin = NULL, seasonal = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapes}{Object of class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame (see function \code{\link{readShapePoly}} 
to open these files).}

\item{presence}{A vector with the code numbers for the presence type to be maintained.}

\item{origin}{A vector with the code numbers for the origin type to be maintained.}

\item{seasonal}{A vector with the code numbers for the seasonal type to be maintained.}
}
\value{
The result is the shapefile(s) filtered according to the selected types. If the filters remove all polygons, the result will be NULL.
